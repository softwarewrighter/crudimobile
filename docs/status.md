---

## Upcoming Tasks

### Next Up

1. Initialize React Native project
2. Configure build system
3. Set up testing framework
4. Implement infrastructure layer

### Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 Days)

- Initialize React Native TypeScript project
- Configure Android build for Java 17, Gradle 8.x, Android SDK 35
- Set up ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks
- Configure Jest and React Native Testing Library
- Set up Detox for E2E testing
- Verify project builds and runs on Android

### Medium-term Goals (Next 1 Week)

- Implement infrastructure layer (API client, storage, sensors, camera)
- Implement domain layer (entities, value objects, business rules)
- Implement application layer (use cases, state management)
- Begin presentation layer (navigation, authentication screens)

### Long-term Goals (Next 2-3 Weeks)

- Complete all presentation layer screens
- Implement comprehensive test suite
- Add logging and monitoring
- Optimize performance
- Complete MVP and acceptance testing
- Release first version

## Risk Assessment

| Risk                                 | Status | Mitigation                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| API compatibility issues             | Low    | Will test early with backend              |
| Sensor availability varies by device | Medium | Implementing graceful degradation         |
| Performance with large datasets      | Low    | Will use virtualization and pagination    |
| Testing framework setup complexity   | Low    | Following best practices, starting simple |

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create documentation (COMPLETED)
2. ⏭️ Initialize React Native project
3. ⏭️ Configure Android build
4. ⏭️ Set up testing framework
5. ⏭️ Set up pre-commit hooks
6. ⏭️ Begin TDD implementation of infrastructure layer

---

## Notes

- Following strict TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor)
- All commits must pass pre-commit checks
- No bypassing of hooks or tests
- Detailed commit messages required
- Focus on MVP features first
- Documentation updated as we progress

---
